"Effects of AI-Generated Labels in News Media on Confirmation Bias, Memory Retention, and Credibility Perception"

Overview:
This repository contains the design and planning materials for the research study titled “Effects of AI-Generated Labels in News Media on Confirmation Bias, Memory Retention, and Credibility Perception”. The study aims to investigate how labeling news content as AI-generated or human-authored influences users' cognitive biases, memory retention, and perceptions of credibility. This project was developed as part of my cognitive psychology class and outlines the theoretical framework, experimental design, and methodological approach intended for future implementation.

Research Objectives:
    1)- Confirmation Bias: Explore how AI-generated labels affect the tendency to favor information that aligns with pre-existing beliefs.
    2)- Memory Retention: Assess the potential impact of content labeling on the ability to recall factual details from news articles.
    3)- Credibility Perception: Evaluate how different labels influence the perceived credibility and trustworthiness of news content.

Methodology
The proposed study employs a between-subjects experimental design with three conditions:

   1)-  AI-Generated Label: Articles marked as generated by artificial intelligence.
   2)- Human-Authored Label: Articles marked as authored by a human writer.
   3)- Control Condition: Articles presented without any labels.

Participants will be evaluated on:
    1)- Attention Allocation: Measured through response times and accuracy in distractor tasks.
    2)-Memory Retention: Assessed using recall tests with multiple-choice and short-answer questions.
    3)- Trust Evaluation: Measured via a 7-point Likert scale survey focusing on credibility, objectivity, and reliability.
